\section{Ken's last idea as of 01/08/16}
\textbf{01/07/2016}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Proteins fold and catalyze, they are all ribosomes functionally.
\item Let's add something else -- nucleic acids. They can be catalyzed too to become longer, but 
for that different proteins are used.  
\item To activate amino acids we need ATP. An activated ATP is so similar no nucleic acid\ncite
\item But how RNA codes for protein. \textbf{strange question...}
\item We have distribution of capabilities for both (polymers or types of catalysts??)
\item \textbf{Claim:} If one of the distributions gets tighter, another gets tighter too.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{01/08/2016}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In our findings on HP we got that some chains will be long enough to act.
 \item Suppose we have RNA, which are polymerized 3-phospates. 3 phospates have 2 roles: they help 
proteins and constituents of RNA.
\item There's a weak genetic code between RNA and protein -- less than $1 kT$. 
\item Suppose I have a protein.

\item \textbf{We also want to answer:}
\subitem Why there's asymmetry?
\subitem Why RNA codes for protein and not vice versa?
\subitem What's physics here?
\item Some foldamers are R and some are P \textbf{CHECK?}
\item \textbf{Super important.} There's an asymmetry between Informational and Functional 
proteins. A lot of RNA's don't fold nicely\ncite. RNA fold -- a lot of promiscuity\ncite, because 
it's a backbone code: all I gonna get is globe(\textbf{CHECK?}). What is it bout more flexible 
polymer compared to more collapsible one? Is this the thing which causes the asymmetry?
\item \textbf{More on asymmetry:} Protein when collapses -- very tough. 
\item Doesn't cause much free energy \textbf{CHECK?}
\item In RNA-HP interactions P don't matter.
\item Correlation protein-RNA and selection on protein leads to selection on RNA. Second flow of 
information. RNA to protein. If we change HP does it go to RNA?
\end{itemize}

\section{Old notes -- possibly irrelevant}
 \begin{center}
  {\Large \textbf{Two polymers instead of one}}
 \end{center}
Ken believes 1 polymer isn't capable of generating life.
instead we need 2 -- functional, which gets destroyed quickly and informational, which is more 
stable.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Legend to Petri Nets diagrams, which I'm using here
\begin{figure}[h!]

\item Good. (Machines get destroyed faster than Blueprints)

\item Bad.

\subsection{What used to be a new approach}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
We have two types of polymers: memory polymer and function polymer. 
\item They are located inside little 
droplets. 
\item Different droplets have different sequences. Therefore those sequences vary in efficiency of
whatever they are doing.
\item Whenever a droplet gets a couple of functional sequences, the growth of the droplet starts and
essentially it splits into two daughter cells
\item Functional polymers get recycled faster. But Informational polymers live longer.
\red{Oops!! We don't have degradation in our model. Things are getting awfully complicated.}
\item Each time a new sequence is being produced on the basis of an old one, mistakes can be made. 
Number of mistakes has its distribution; either Gauss or Poisson.  
\item If the mapping memory-function is too broad, then we end up producing random sequences, and 
cells stop propagating efficiently. However, if we are lucky, then cells happen to win. \red{Lucky 
in what??}
\item The output number in number of copies of cells of a given cell type. The more -- the better.
\end{itemize}
